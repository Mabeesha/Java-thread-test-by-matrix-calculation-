# Java-thread-test-by-matrix-calculation-
Test about java threads - Analyse the time it takes when multiply two matrices by using java threads with respect to different parameters(data type , Matrix size, number of threads)

There are different Test files(diffent matrix sizes).It can be tested with those files by renaming the parts(where the file names are) in the code.

number of threads has to be given as a command line argument.

To test it with different data types small changes must be done in the code.
